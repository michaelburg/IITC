// This is how we print something in the console 👇
console.log("Hello Javascript");

// This is how we declare a variable 👇
let number;
number = 10; // 👈 This is how we assign a value to a variable

// We can also declare and assign a value to a variable in one line like this 👇
let anotherNumber = 20;

// We can print the value of a variable in the console 👇
console.log(number);

// We can print multiple values in the console like this 👇
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";
console.log("first name is -", firstName);
console.log("last name is -", lastName);

// We can create new variables by combining the values of other variables like this 👇
// Note: In this case we are adding a space (' ') between the first and last name
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
console.log("full name is -", fullName);

// We can change the value of a variable like this 👇
let age = 30;
console.log("age is -", age);

age = age + 1;
console.log("increment age...");
console.log("the new age is -", age);

// const is used to declare a constant variable.
// The value of a constant variable cannot be changed!
const myId = "1234";
myId = "5678"; // ❌ This will throw an error because we are trying to change the value of a constant
